Zhou Mi’s Reminiscences of Wulin captured the nostalgic mood of the Southern Song, shaping the poetic tradition of “history within verse.” Later poets like Gong Zizhen drew inspiration from West Lake’s scenery, experimenting with the “Xingling” (emotive authenticity) theory and leaving behind many celebrated lines.",
